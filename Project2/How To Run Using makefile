These are instructions on how to run my code using the makefile:

1) Download and place the makefile, compile.c, lexer.c, and input.pl0 in the same folder on Eustis (or normal folder if using linux and terminal).
2) On Eustis or in the terminal, run the makefile using "make compile".
3) now you can run the executable like so: "./compile input.pl0 output.pm0".
